# 🌆 UrbanOptima – AI-Driven Sustainable Cities Dashboard

**UrbanOptima** is a powerful AI-powered dashboard designed to optimize urban sustainability through data-driven decision-making. Our platform uses advanced machine learning and predictive analytics to forecast air quality, traffic congestion, energy consumption, water usage, and waste generation. It empowers city planners, governments, and communities with actionable insights for building smarter, greener cities.

## 🔑 Core Features

### 1. 🌀 Predictive Air Quality Monitoring
- Forecast 7-day air quality trends using historical weather, traffic, and pollution data.
- Suggest interventions (e.g., traffic restrictions in high-pollution zones).
- **New:** Predictive heatmaps by location and time.

### 2. 🚦 Traffic Congestion Forecasting
- Identify congestion hotspots using historical data, events, and weather.
- Provide alternate route recommendations using **Reinforcement Learning**.
- **New:** Traffic flow forecast by zone and hour.

### 3. 💧 Water Usage Optimization
- Detect anomalous consumption patterns (e.g., leaks, excessive use).
- Forecast water demand based on seasonality and population trends.
- **New:** User-specific conservation tips.

### 4. ⚡ Energy Consumption Insights
- Forecast energy needs with time-series models.
- Compare renewable vs non-renewable sources.
- **New:** Optimal usage hours and renewable integration plans.

### 5. 🗑️ Waste Management Optimization
- Predict waste generation by zone for smart scheduling.
- Use AI for route optimization in waste collection.
- **New:** Insights to boost recycling rates.
